This is a snowflake simulator written in python by Rachael Holmes and Giles
Hall.  It builds realistic looking snowflakes by modeling the phase
transistions between water molecules at a mesoscopic scale.  The model is
lifted (verbatim) from "MODELING SNOW CRYSTAL GROWTH II: A mesoscopic lattice
map with plausible dynamics" by Janko Gravner and David Griffeath.

Requirements:
    * PyPy (for fast execution of the simulations)
    * PIL for exporting graphics (PyPy accesible)

Requirements for Laser Cutting:
    * Python only (no PyPy support)
    * PIL (Python accessible)
    * potrace (For translating SVG)
    * scipy/numpy (For clustering)

Requirements for 3D Printing:

    * PyPy or Python
    * PIL (PyPy/Python accessible)
    * potrace (For translating SVG)
    * pstoedit (For generating EPS)
    * ghostscript v 9.20 (For generating DXF. Versions > 9.20 break this functionaliy)
    * OpenSCAD (For generating STL)
    * CURA (For generating gcode. Currently not working)
